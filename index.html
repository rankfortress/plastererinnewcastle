	The best way to create a radical design for your property is with the help of expertly-placed walls. Walls can be used in many ways, from creating new spaces or converting old ones into something more modern and stylish. They are also great at adding utility by opening up an area that may have been too small before! Plasterboard is an excellent material for creating safe and reliable new interior walls. These expansive sheets of gypsum are compressed firmly between two layers: the ‘facer’ layer, which faces outward to form a wall; and one or more backer layers that provide structural integrity.
